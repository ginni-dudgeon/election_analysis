Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used for any election in the future. Some medications will be necessary. The analyst will need to consider how large the election is. This audit focused on the number of votes in total, the number of votes per county and who the winning candidate was. Future audits could look at how many registered voters are in each county and specify how many votes each candidate received in each county. This script can be used for both small and large elections.
